For this game, you are playing the part of villagers who need a safe way to cross the road and get to the river. The arrow keys will move your player in the four directions. Enemy bugs will capture your player if they meet up with him or her. But a new girl or boy from the village will appear to carry on the task.

Scattered on the board are three magic gems. If you place them in a **vertical line** across the road, in the **proper order,** they will create a rainbow bridge that the villagers can use to cross safely over the bugs. You pick up or place gems by using the **`spacebar`.** If you have picked up a gem and go to place it where another gem is located, the one you are holding will be placed on the board and the one that was on the board will be picked up at the same time.

The sequence that the gems need to be placed in to create the bridge changes each time you refresh the game. But as this game is primarily a demonstration of using Javascript and a little Canvas with a game engine, the difficulty level is quite low: there are only 6 possible ways to order the 3 gems, and it doesn't matter whether you place them to the left or right on the board as long as they are in a line top to bottom across the road and in the proper order.

Once you get the rainbow bridge to appear, the game is over (for now...), although you can go on the bridge and enjoy your new immunity from the bugs for as long as you want.
